        This [Fall 2023](https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/editions/2023-fall/#dates) [DataFirst project](https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/) attempts to [analyze code commits(source code and patch discussions) of open-source software to better understand them](problem-statement). |
        Gaining a deeper understanding of OSS ecosystems will enable the open-source community to identify potential vulnerabilities, and define better development practices. |
        We use [data](data) from Linux Kernel Mailing List. Our [work](approach) focuses on extracting clean messages from the raw data and performing keyword extraction and summarization on individual messages and patch discussions. Our initial [results](results) indicate that most clean messages can be extracted through regular expression, and keyword extraction and summarization can be accomplished with the help of large language models such as GPT4.
