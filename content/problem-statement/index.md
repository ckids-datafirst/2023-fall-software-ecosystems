## Motivation

Open source runs a lot of the world's critical software systems, but there is much that's unknown in how maintainers, developers and other parts of the software ecosystem function. This project attempts to analyze code commits of open source software repositories, that includes both source code and patch conversations, to better understand them.

## Problem for the Semester

* Extract clean messages on the raw data from Linux Kernel Mailing List.
* Extract keywords from individual messages and patch discussions.
* Generate a summarization from each individual messages and patch discussions.
* Leverage the power of large language models to accomplish keyword extraction and summarization.

## State of the Art

Provide a brief summary or survey of the possible approaches, advances, or tools that are currently available that could potentially be used to address the problem.  

## Design and Approach

Discuss the initial approach that the team will follow.  This may include the key idea that the team believes could potentially work, and a high-level description of 1) the system to be built and a diagram of its components, 2) the inputs to the system and the task that it will do with that data, and 3) the outputs to be generated. Discuss also a baseline system that is simple and can be quickly built to address the problem in a reasonable way even if it has poor performance, so that you can clearly show improvements.  Discuss also how those improvements will be demonstrated through metrics or other means.

## Use Case Scenario

Show with a use case scenario with examples of who the ultimate users could be, what the system that you plan to build for the semester will do in that scenario.  Provide a mockup of the outputs for the use case that you propose.

## Desired Outcomes and Benefits

Connect back the system that you will be building with the initial motivation for the work, and what additional future work might be needed in order for the system to provide benefits to its users.
