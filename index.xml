It should be no more than 3 pages long. It should be done after or in combination with the Requirements document. It should have an initial release after no more than eight weeks into the project, and can serve as an interim project report. It can be refined as the project progresses and the problem is better understood.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-quality">Data Quality&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Describe any steps that were used to address any issues concerning the quality of the data. This may include collecting data quality metrics, discarding subsets of the data, or applying specific techniques for handling missing values, dealing with outliers, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-preprocessing">Data Preprocessing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Describe the steps taken to preprocess the raw data to prepare it for analysis. This may include data transformations to convert to a required format, feature engineering operations, encoding features as binary, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="exploratory-data-analysis-eda">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Discuss any techniques employed to gain insights into the data. This could include data visualizations, generating summary statistics, initial analysis, and other exploratory techniques used to understand the data distributions, features, and helpful patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="model-development">Model Development&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Describe the algorithms, methodology, and architectures used to generate models. Discuss how models were generated, seeded, and improved. Show the libraries and frameworks used for model development, as well as the rationale behind those choices.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="model-evaluation">Model Evaluation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Discuss the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance, and justify those choices based on the problem that the project is addressing. Describe the evaluation techniques used, such as cross-validation, and how undesirable model behaviors, such as overfitting, were avoided.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Assessment</title><link>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-software-ecosystems/data/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-software-ecosystems/data/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our project uses data from &lt;a href="https://lkml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux Kernel Mailing List&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-overview-and-examples">Data Overview and Examples&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The data contains technical discussions on the design of and bugs in the Linux kernel. It is collected with a Python script and serves as our data source to develop our project. As of now, only a small portion of the data has been used to debug and evaluate our code. However, we might analyze all the available data from the mailing list in future works.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-accessibility">Data Accessibility&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The data is public on &lt;a href="https://lkml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LKML.ORG&lt;/a>. You can access the archived messages directly from the website.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-formats-and-challenges">Data Formats and Challenges&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The data is in email format which contains the time stamp, author&amp;rsquo;s information, subject and content of the email. It contains both source codes and commit messages. Since the data contains some useless texts, we need to extract the clean messages. We use certain symbols as delimiters and leverage the power of regular expression to implement a parser for the raw data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Problem and Requirements</title><link>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-software-ecosystems/problem-statement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-software-ecosystems/problem-statement/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Open source runs a lot of the world&amp;rsquo;s critical software systems, but there is much that&amp;rsquo;s unknown in how maintainers, developers and other parts of the software ecosystem function. This project attempts to analyze code commits of open source software repositories, that includes both source code and patch conversations, to better understand them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problem-for-the-semester">Problem for the Semester&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Extract clean messages on the raw data from Linux Kernel Mailing List.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Extract keywords from individual messages and patch discussions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generate a summarization from each individual messages and patch discussions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leverage the power of large language models to accomplish keyword extraction and summarization.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="state-of-the-art">State of the Art&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Provide a brief summary or survey of the possible approaches, advances, or tools that are currently available that could potentially be used to address the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="design-and-approach">Design and Approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Discuss the initial approach that the team will follow. This may include the key idea that the team believes could potentially work, and a high-level description of 1) the system to be built and a diagram of its components, 2) the inputs to the system and the task that it will do with that data, and 3) the outputs to be generated. Discuss also a baseline system that is simple and can be quickly built to address the problem in a reasonable way even if it has poor performance, so that you can clearly show improvements. Discuss also how those improvements will be demonstrated through metrics or other means.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="use-case-scenario">Use Case Scenario&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Show with a use case scenario with examples of who the ultimate users could be, what the system that you plan to build for the semester will do in that scenario. Provide a mockup of the outputs for the use case that you propose.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="desired-outcomes-and-benefits">Desired Outcomes and Benefits&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Connect back the system that you will be building with the initial motivation for the work, and what additional future work might be needed in order for the system to provide benefits to its users.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Results</title><link>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-software-ecosystems/results/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-software-ecosystems/results/</guid><description>&lt;p>This page contains key sections of the &lt;strong>Final Report&lt;/strong> for the project focused on results to date.
